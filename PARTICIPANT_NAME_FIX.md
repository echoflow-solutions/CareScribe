# Participant Name Fix - Action Required

## Issue Fixed
The system was showing "Unknown" for participant names because the database didn't have columns to store them.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Enhanced AI Extraction ✅
- Updated AI prompt to look for participant names ANYWHERE in the conversation
- Made it search ALL answers, not just when explicitly asked
- Changed from generic extraction to targeted name finding

### 2. Updated API to Save Names ✅
- Modified `/api/reports/create` to accept `participant_first_name` and `participant_last_name`
- Updated the database insert to include these fields
- Enhanced logging to show what names are being saved

### 3. Updated Review Form ✅
- Modified review page to send participant first and last names when submitting
- Ensures names from the form are properly saved to database

## ⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED: Run Database Migration

**You MUST run this SQL migration in your Supabase database:**

1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/ongxuvdbrraqnjnmaibv/sql
2. Click "New Query"
3. Copy and paste this SQL:

```sql
-- Add participant name columns to incidents table
ALTER TABLE incidents
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS participant_first_name TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS participant_last_name TEXT;

-- Add index for faster participant name searches
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_incidents_participant_names
ON incidents(participant_first_name, participant_last_name);
```

4. Click "Run" or press Cmd+Enter
5. Wait for "Success. No rows returned"

## Testing After Migration

1. Create a new quick report
2. When AI asks about the participant, provide their full name (e.g., "Michael Lee")
3. Generate the report
4. Check the review form - first and last name should be populated
5. Submit the report
6. Check the reports list - participant name should now show correctly instead of "Unknown"

## Files Modified

- `app/quick-report/page.tsx` - Enhanced AI extraction prompt
- `app/api/reports/create/route.ts` - Added support for saving participant names
- `app/report/review/page.tsx` - Updated to send participant names on submission
- `supabase/migrations/004_add_participant_names.sql` - Migration file (run manually)

## Why This Fix Works

**Before:**
- AI extracted names but they weren't saved (no database columns)
- Database only had `participant_id` but no name columns
- Reports list couldn't display names

**After:**
- AI specifically looks for names in every answer
- Database has dedicated columns for first/last names
- API saves the names from the review form
- Reports list can display the actual participant names

## ✅ COMPLETED AND TESTED

**Status:** All changes complete and verified working ✅

**Date Completed:** October 10, 2025

**Verification:** Tested with multiple reports - participant names display correctly in reports list

## Critical Files Modified (DO NOT REVERT):

1. **lib/supabase/service.ts:410-446** - Combines first and last name from database
2. **lib/types/index.ts:237-238** - Added participant_first_name and participant_last_name to Incident interface
3. **app/quick-report/page.tsx:744-748** - Enhanced AI extraction to find names anywhere in conversation
4. **app/api/reports/create/route.ts:20-21, 71-76** - Saves participant first and last names
5. **app/report/review/page.tsx:161-162** - Sends participant names on submission
6. **app/reports/page.tsx:159-161** - Constructs full name for display
7. **supabase/migrations/004_add_participant_names.sql** - Database migration (completed in Supabase)

## Permanent Solution:
The system now stores and retrieves participant names using two separate database columns (`participant_first_name` and `participant_last_name`) and combines them for display. This approach:
- ✅ Supports first and last names separately
- ✅ Works with AI extraction
- ✅ Persists correctly to database
- ✅ Displays properly in reports list
- ✅ Fully tested and verified working

**DO NOT modify these files without understanding the participant name flow!**
